This is a list of resources for learning Flutter beyond the basics. It includes books, videos, and other resources that will help you take your Flutter skills to the next level.

## Introduction

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform (mobile, web, desktop, and embedded) applications from a single codebase.

Flutter is powered by Dart, a language optimized for fast apps on any platform.
(mobile, web, desktop, and embedded)
