I took the attendees through the process of developing real-world apps, using some of the apps I had built before, including Calcut with over 7,000 users, Cupertino Icons Gallery (Open Source) with over 5,000 users and 19 Github Stars, Shoplix, Kalya Courts app, and many others. I also taught them how Flutter made it easy to create beautiful, high-performance apps for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop, and I demonstrated this through live demos of my apps.",
