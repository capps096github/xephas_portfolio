## Deep Dive: Astro

[Astro][1] is a modern front-end framework for building faster websites using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's designed to be a better starting point for building modern websites, and it's a great fit for building static sites, blogs, and dynamic apps.

## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
